# AirTabla

Engineered a virtual Tabla (Indian Instrument) using OpenCV, leveraging the systemâ€™s camera to detect precise hand movements and generate distinct musical sounds. This interdisciplinary project exemplifies the fusion of computer vision and traditional Indian music. Collaborating with my project partner, we dedicated extensive research and programming efforts to create the innovative 'Air Tabla,' demonstrating the potential of integrating diverse fields to drive innovation.

We took inspiration from David Rokeby's "A Very Nervous System" (the idea of producing music with movement from the body) and Indian Musical culture. The idea of merging the classic indian instrument, the tabla, with modern computer vision technology was executed to produce the "Air Tabla".

This is a project I worked on for a undergraduate course, SM2702 - "Interdisciplinary skills and practices". The course enlightened me on the importance of interdisciplinarity in art and innovation.
