# AirTabla
 
 This is the project I worked on for a university course, SM2702 - "Interdisciplinary skills and practices". The course enlightened me on the importance of interdisciplinarity in art and innovation.
 
Taking inspiration from David Rokeby's "A Very Nervous System", which focused on the idea of producing music with movement from the body, and indian culture. It sparked the idea of merging the classic indian instrument the tabla with modern computer vision technology to produce the "Air Tabla".
